About me

I was born in 1980 in Bielefeld, Germany. On account of my own disease, at the age of 13 I already had contact with natural therapies, among them homeopathy. Thanks to a breakthrough with the homeopathic treatment I could witness in which way this medicine makes a better life possible for me.

Various years passed before a wish in me awoke to transmit this type of healing to others. After having worked as an IT consultant in Germany, I went to Ireland for a few years where I did a training as music producer and yoga teacher, the latter mainly for my personal development. Subsequently I realised that my interest in helping others was my true vocation. As a tool for this I chose homeopathy.

Back in Germany I completed an intensive course encompassing conventional medicine and homeopathy. In 2012 I passed my exam before the public health department. Since then I practise with all my heart, studying and deepening my knowledge with books, seminars and exchanges amoung colleagues. Homeopathy, health and personal growth as a human being in this universe are topics that will fascinate me for all my life.

In my experience, homeopathy is one of the most complete and profound therapies there are, that have been verified over a long time. Time and again I attest to or hear about astonishing healings - which is another source of motivation for me. It is a pleasure for me to accompany people on their path in life and support them in big and small crises. And above all watch them emerge stronger.
