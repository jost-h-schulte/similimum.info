## Treatment details

To arrive at a suitable remedy I have a thorough and detailed conversation with the patient where I ask all about their presenting complaints and other strong influences in their history. Examination and medical diagnoses can give additional information. In cases where patients cannot speak for themselves, relatives or other persons close to the patient are consulted.

## Typical progression

Homeopathy is a profound and extensive art of healing that takes its time. For an initial consultation I calculate between 1 and 2 hours, for children less than for adolescents and adults. Sometimes further studying of the case is required after the consultation to determine the appropriate remedy. Depending upon the development of the patient's state we arrange follow up appointments periodically.

**The objective of a homeopathic therapy is to bring the patient to a higher level of health and wellbeing.**

## Fees

For my work I charge the following fees:

* First consultation from 0 to 18 years of age: **50 Euro**
* First consultation from 19 years onwards: **60 Euro**
* Consecutive consultations: **40 Euro**

You can pay cash or by credit card.

_Should you not have the financial means to pay the treatment, we will surely find an agreement._
